3 Ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML:

1.Colour contrast - Verify that the colour contrast between text and background meets the WCAG contrast 
requirements. Ensure that information conveyed through colour is also available via other means 

2.Using Semantic Tags - for ensuring proper heading structure or semantic structure of HTML - practice the use of proper semantic structure, by using appropriate HTML elements like <h1>,<nav>,<main>,<article>,<button> and <label> to convey the purpose and role of each element.

3.Using alt attribute in image tag - 
we can add descriptive alternative text to all images using the alt attribute. This is helpful for those who cannot see the images but can understand the content and purpose.
